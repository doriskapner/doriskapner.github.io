Quietly. Softly. Watching.  
How sweetly the adored sleeps.  
Gently caress the eyelids.  
The beauty of a potential lover  
Before reality walks in.  

How innocently one falls in love.  
How easily one can begin to care.  
Beware of the purity of emotion  
For the response it meets  
Is often destructive  
Easily shattered by another  
Who fails to even notice.  

Tears are worthless  
Except for the acknowledgement of pain  
By the one who sheds them  
Slowly or rapidly, however they fall.  

Longing for embrace  
We find the broken-hearted.  
The only comfort they find  
Is when they fall asleep.  
Innocent and peaceful they appear  
As they are watched  
Perhaps by someone  
They will never love.
