In sleep, lost  
Clear, forgotten  
Hint, thin mist  
In time,  
Keep missing.  
Truth, vague  
And fleeting.  

Touch, a thought  
Rather than a sense  
Grasping at images  
Drawing embraces  
Feeling colors  
Hearing faces.  

Tiptoeing thunders on the floorboards  
Beneath my eyelids  
And your laughter  
Trickles down my heart  
And lands on my pillow.
