Self discovery for myself and the viewer  
Always learning  
Dialogue  
I rip a part of myself out  
And present it.  
Anyone can look  
Some will see  
Even fewer will know.  

Sometimes I shake  
Sometimes I look away.  
Always I will be there again  
Because I am alive.  

If I could show others  
This path  
The tools  
The means.  
Help them know  
How much  
There is  
To discover.  
This path  
Where I must be  
Student  
And  
Teacher.
