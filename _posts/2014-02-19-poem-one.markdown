Lost  
Beside myself  
Not beside me  
Where? Swimming  
Thinking, behind me?  
Forge ahead  
Now eternal  
Present a myth  
Pleading memory  
Or reality?  
Song sung  
To Ethers  
Hear inside  
Please respond  
Love everlasting  
Spirit unite  

Of course &hellip; Untie  
And then we come together  
One
