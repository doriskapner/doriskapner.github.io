Each has a vision  
A depth no one knows  
Beauty or evil  
All are capable of.  

Each has a soul  
Is it full of Love or Hate?  
Or is it half empty?  
Awaiting a decision.  

Each makes a difference  
Each affects the continuity  
Of human nature.  
What lies in the collective?  

Each has a choice  
Each has a fate  
That is evolving.  
May each choose wisely.  
We only have each other.
