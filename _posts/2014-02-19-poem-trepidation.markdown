Trepidation.  

Exile  
eagerness to love  
lost illusion  
continuous shattering  
myself in pieces  
before my eyes  

Nebulae surrounds me  
it is my hopefulness  
which defeats me  
the search from loneliness  
brings ever more pain.  

Why do they tread  
upon my emotion  
which would be so pure?  
why do they imagine  
I remain unscathed  
by their neglect?  

Ever smiling  
eyes ever crying  
fa&ccedil;ade so willfully surrendered  
and no victory won  
now standing unguarded  
a willing victim  
to all the pain  

Once again loneliness  
the only constant  
the undying faithfulness  
of a true friend
